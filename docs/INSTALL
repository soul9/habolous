Habolous uses cabal for deployment

Install on windows
===================
 - install haskell-platform from http://haskell.org/platform
 - install postgresql server from http://www.postgresql.org/
 - install mingw and msys (latest directory on http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-inst/)
 - run cabal update
 - finally, type cabal install in the habolous directory (or use a distributed tarball)

Postgresql problems with the tools not being in the windows path
=================================================================
to make cabal (and HDBC-postgresql) work on windows correctly, add the cabal path to your windows path:
  right click on "Computer" -> "Properties"
  go to "Advanced system settings"
  click the "Environment Variables" button
  in "System Variables" edit the "Path" variable
  at the beginning of the "Variable value" line, add c:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.2\bin;C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\cabal\bin;
                                                   replace Admin with your login

Problems with MissingH and directory >= 1.2.0.0
================================================
The error will be about some time problem, disregard that, here is the solution.
to install configfile on win32, we need to NOT install directory >= 1.2, so use this command to install habolous (or configfile:)
    cabal install --constraint="directory < 1.2.0.0"


Running Habolous
================
To run the app, you need to create a configuration file with the required database information. There is an example file in the examples directory, and pass it as argument to the binary.
For example: habolous c:\dbconfig.conf


creating binary packages
=========================
(from http://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/installing-packages.html#creating-a-binary-package)
./Setup.hs configure --user
./Setup.hs build
./Setup.hs copy --destdir=/my/bin/destination
./Setup.hs register --gen-script
./Setup.hs unregister --gen-script
mv register.bat /my/bin/destination
mv unregister.bat /my/bin/destination
